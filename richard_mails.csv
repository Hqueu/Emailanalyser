suitor for enron receives approval from wall st.
by alex berenson

11/13/2001
the new york times
page 13, column 1
c. 2001 new york times company

wall street found nothing but good news in dynegy's $9 billion takeover of the enron corporation yesterday. 
three days after dynegy, an energy marketing and trading company based in houston, agreed to take over enron, its giant crosstown rival, dynegy executives came to new york to assure investors that the deal would sharply increase their company's profits. they met a receptive audience.
dynegy stock closed yesterday at $44.31, up $5.55, or 14.3 percent. since last wednesday, when news of a possible takeover emerged, dynegy's stock has risen more than one-third. enron closed at $9.24, up 61 cents, or 7.1 percent. 
after some initial uncertainty about the takeover, investors appear to have accepted dynegy's view that the deal will give it a lucrative franchise in trading natural gas and electricity. enron's stock fell almost 80 percent in the weeks leading up to the deal as enron said it had overstated its earnings by almost $600 million since 1997 and forced out several top executives. 
but chuck watson, dynegy's chairman, told investors repeatedly yesterday that enron's problems were mainly a result of failed expansion efforts. he largely dismissed the concerns of some short-sellers and analysts that enron might be hiding losses at its core energy trading operations. 
''there's nothing wrong with enron's business,'' mr. watson said in an interview at the waldorf-astoria hotel after making a lunchtime presentation to analysts and investors. ''the people in it ought to be really upset that for the last several years, they have produced earnings and cash that have been invested in other businesses that are not making money.'' 
enron's immediate problem was a crisis of confidence, which could have caused other companies to stop trading with it, mr. watson said. a $1.5 billion cash infusion from dynegy should restore the confidence of enron's business partners and keep enron stable until the takeover is complete, he said. to bolster enron further, j. p. morgan chase and citigroup may each invest an additional $250 million, executives close to the deal said. the potential investments by j. p. morgan chase and citigroup were reported yesterday in the wall street journal. 
mr. watson said dynegy would also move quickly to assuage enron employees who are angry that kenneth l. lay, enron's chairman, and other top executives sold hundreds of millions of dollars in stock in 2000 and this year as enron's shares plunged. ''right now, there's some animosity over there,'' he said. 
many employees at enron will get new grants of stock options when the acquisition is completed, he said. the company said it expected the deal to close by the end of the third quarter of next year, after extensive reviews from federal and state energy regulators and the department of justice. 
mr. watson predicted that the deal would lift dynegy's earnings by 90 cents or more a share next year, to more than $3.45 a share. 
analysts backed that view yesterday. ''investments in noncore business distracted the attention of management and also took up capital,'' said thomas hamlin, an analyst at wachovia securities. mr. hamlin said he believed that dynegy had obtained enron, which reported more than $100 billion in revenue last year, for a bargain price. 
''it's not too often you get to take out the no. 7 fortune 500 company and double your earnings in the meantime,'' he said. ''my guess is the stock is worth $70 per share.'' 
the deal could increase dynegy's earnings by $1 to $2 a share next year, said christopher ellinghaus, an analyst at the williams capital group. 
''that's a whopper,'' he said. ''it's a very good deal financially, certainly should be a good deal strategically, and provides some immediate balance-sheet backstop for enron.'' 
mr. lay said in an interview that enron had been forced to sell itself because of ''the relentlessness of all the articles and the shorts.'' 
''we realized that we needed to do something to stabilize the ship,'' he said. ''a good company was being badly tarnished.''

attached is a rough draft for our puct filing.  initial review (subject to
check with enron) is that the combined parties generation in the ercot
region will exceed the 1% review threshold but be far below the 20% action
level.  i roughed out the elements of a filing based on the dynegy/illinova
docket from two years ago.  i have a meeting scheduled with chairman
yzaguirre tomorrow afternoon--thought i might provide him with the table on
generation interests within ercot and alert him to the pending request.

rick:

i hope that i am not exceeding my authority from risk analytics perspective by seeking your permission to comment on the suggested new structure of the department.  if you think that this is not necessary at this stage, i would like to communicate the following points:

the concern of risk analytics is to ensure the following:
1.	the different business activities, and the different regions are well identified and covered, yet not isolated from each other to negatively impact synergy.  
2.	the suggested structure clearly identifies lines of responsibility, and accountability.
3.	the above lines of responsibility, and accountability, pass through your primary support direct system (i.e., jim steffes); this is at least as far as the ""regulatory-intensive"" functions.    
4.	ensure that support functions (e.g. database management, regulatory research) are well connected to the different components of the department.

i am confident that you had addressed these issues, however, and  to stop beating around the bush, i  just want to discuss further point 3 above for its relative importance in the coming period.  

i look forward for any question or comment

2001-11-13 14:10:27-08:00,luiz.maurer,tax issues related to elektro,"
follow up on this issue.

i did not hear from sergio yet.

i checked cvm resolution # oficio/cvm/sep/gea-1 number 04/01, dated november 08. (therefore, the enron/dynegy merge date is pure serendipity)

the issue is related to the reverse merger, but it is more complex than we thought.

the commission ordered elektro to republish 2001, 1q2001 and 2q2002 statements. the commission argues that:

1) the deferral of income tax and social contribution was not legitimate, as it was based on irrealistic profit assumptions
2) that instructions regarding the term to ammortize part of the reverse merger, issues in 1999, have not been followed (cvm instruction 319/99, which approved the reverse merger)
3) the economic rationale for the ammortization of the larger part of the ""premium""  paid for elektro does not hold any longer and that cvm instruction 349/2001 is not being followed
4) as per law 6.385/76, elektro will have to republish the balance sheets/income statements

elektro has 15 days to appeal

lm"
2001-11-13 14:54:12-08:00,luiz.maurer,re: esa government negotiations/ corrected,"my initial reaction:

1) rationing losses

i was afraid of this outcome. at least on the surface, i do not like it.  

i have the impression that  it  washes away elektro's initial long position as elektro as it puts and end to annex v discussions. i would have to see the numbers to check  that this solution is equivalent to annex v (for enron). it depends on how one defines ""rationing losses"". 

this solution is perfect  for companies like aes, who were both short in the generation and  in the distribution  businesses. they win on both sides. how are they going to treat annex v provisions when load curtailment reduces to 10% and annex v becomes a liability for elektro? what is going to happen with annex v? (it may be part of the agreement - it is not clear though)

from an elecric sector perspective, this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity. bad for future investments. 
it would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full pass-through. 

2) ok

3) this had already been achieved. it was an mp (law) enacted by minister parente. the only way we were able to get it was to take aneel to court (here comes my point again - why not being equally bold regarding annex v? perhaps aes influence on abradee?)

what are the terms of final settlement? will they have any provision regarding annex v?

"" by  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the annex 5 controversy the mae should function normally, allowing us to operate eletrobolt and settle against the pool""

three comments:

1) technically not correct - mae recently stopped because of a legal  injunction of itaipu  energy. 
2) it is key to have a functioning mae for eletrobolt. why has abradee voted in favor or procrastinating mae operation three times in the recent past and enron has not exercised a dissenting vote?

"" our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes""   

i would rather not comment on this statement

disegard previous e-mail.
we  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on sunday night.  the main points are:  

     1. rationing losses:   defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from june 01 until the end of rationing in 02. recovery includes financial compensation. immediate funding of 80% through bndes, with brazilian government funds. loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  funding scheduled by december 15th.  elektro ebitda impact of approximately r$163 million or us$ 63 million. corrected numbers in second email

       2.  april/may mae settlement :   market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on elektro's books.  impact of approximately r$ 18 million or us$ 7 million. 

       3.  parcel  ""a"" for the future:  all non-controlable costs to which ldc's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the ldc tariff revision date.  tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. elektro ebitda impact  2002 forward of r$ 60 million or us$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  this methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. parcel a from the past:   min parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the federal attorney general's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    elektro impact  is r$145 million or us$ 55 million in 2001. the proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

we are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

min parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  these  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. by  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the annex 5 controversy the mae should function normally, allowing us to operate eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

total amounts for the sector represent about r$ 10 billion or us$3.8 billion at the current rates.  our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.  "

tom et al--you guys could do color commentary! and yes, your visit to pennsylvania was obviously presuasive. thanks for the update.  

rick/jim/sue--one of the things we need to talk about in a general context is how we are going to address the enron swipes in these types of forums.  i imagine they are going to continue for many months to come and my initial thought is to make sure that we have enron people at as many forums and conferences as there are out there and not shy away from public visibility. i'm not sure how i feel about whether we should be trying to get spots on the panels and whether if we do that, it should be a high level person like a rick or a jim.  a strategic discussion on this issue in the near term would be appreciated.

subject:	naruc day 1

monday's naruc convention consisted of three sessions, 1)opening remarks; 2) ferc rto policy update; and 3) a session on attracting capital to the energy infrastructure. 

1)	opening remarks - the convention opened with remarks by naruc president william nugent, ferc commissioner nora brownell, pa puc chairman glenn thomas (substituting for former governor ridge), and the featured speaker comcast cable president brian roberts.  
a.	nugent rambled on about how this is an interesting period we are in and how regulators are being challenges and didn't much of anything.
b.	brownell introduced a georgia commissioner named bubba who sang several patriotic songs (she did not address anything relative to ferc policy or activity)
c.	thomas spoke about the great state of pa, benjamin franklin, william penn, and philadelphia and also did not address anything related to policy
d.	roberts talked about the future of cable television.
2)	the ferc policy update - this panel consisted of moderator nugent, ferc staff dan larcamp, southern company chairman allen franklin, james torgenson of dpl, and pa commissioner terence fitzpatrick.  
a.	larcamp and did not provide very much information or in-site into ferc rto policy.  he did say that they are looking at compatible market rules and protocols across all the rto's (what he didn't say was that they would be the same rules and protocols).  he said that they are looking at 3 rto's at least,  in the midwest the alliance is moving forward and miso is getting bigger with the addition of spp and that ferc is looking at if the midwest rto should be 1 or 2 rto's; in the northeast they are looking to resolve the governance and market views issues and that all views must be considered (i took this to mean that on governance they are going to go three/three/three from each iso, but others i talked with outside the session didn't get that - time will tell); and the southeast will be slower to develop, there are small but clear regional differences that are important, and that it must accommodate the for-profits and the not-for-profits (public power).
b.	franklin from southern said that the state commissioners are ultimately held accountable for rto's (interesting comment) and there are two major issues to be considered in forming rto's - cost and reliability and that neither can be taken for granted.  he promoted variable electric transmission pricing similar to natural gas transportation rates and not postage stamp rates (he used the example that in his service territory natural gas is located in the southeast part of the territory while load is centered in the north, but since there is a single electrical transmission rate generation is built close to the natural gas source to avoid the variable gas transmission rate).  he promoted the setrans model to accommodate the many public power entities in the south.
c.	torgenson of dpl gave a very dry overview of the status of miso with nothing new to report.
d.	fitzpatrick of pa (one of the commissioners steffes, montovano, and i met with in july) began by stating the pa commission is fully supportive of the nerto (must have been our july meeting) for two reasons i) advantages of a bigger market, and ii) ferc's clear preference for pjm as the platform.  he mentioned the concern of commissions in other pjm states but, in general there is support.  he then went on to stress the merits of dsm.
3)	the last session on infrastructure capital was the most entertaining from an enron perspective (we have quickly  become the fodder for case studies and enron is now a verb that is more akin to a four-letter verb.  the panel consisted of moderator iowa commissioner diane munns, charles cicchetti of pacific economic group, jeff miller of j.p. morgan partners, christine uspenski of schwab capital markets, and walter rogers of merrill lynch asset management.
a.	cicchetti said that wholesale deregulation has made state regulators' job harder and that they must be market participants (he used the term gonzo market participants).  he also thinks that if transmission planning and expansion is left to the rto's, no one will build transmission (no reason given) and that regulators need to be involved.
b.	rogers' (of merrill lynch) most notable comments came as an answer to a question when he stated there are three major issues that are affecting infrastructure investment transactions - california, the downturn in the economy, and enron.
c.	uspenski from schwab told the regulators ""don't get enron'd"".  that if something presented to you doesn't seem to make sense then it doesn't and they should investigate further.
d.	miller from jp morgan also mentioned enron several times in the same context as the others.

2001-11-14 09:33:54-08:00,luiz.maurer,esa negotiations - good news?,"rick

i took a quick  look at the numbers for rationing and what has been achieved.

orlando's statement that the impact on  ebitda was us$ 63 million is very misleading. 

for a simple reason that we are exchanging a u$ 75 million credit (annex v) for a loan. obviously, on an ebitda basis, it may look terrific (this metrics does not take into consideration the payment of the loan). it assumes that the loan is free.

let's for a second give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the loan is indeed free - because it would be repaid with tariff increases over next 36 months which would not be granted otherwise. in that case, the ""credit""  becomes the loan (i only have the overall figure, but i assume that elektro's share will be around us$ 40 million.

if that is the case, the result of the negotiation resulted in a u$ 35 million reduction (by excusing annex v). if one assumes that the tariff increases would happen anyway, the loss is us$ 75 minus the benefit of a subsidized loan. if the latter is u$ 5 million (10% interest and 18% discount rate), the loss would be us 75 million - 5 = us$ 70 million

to summarize.

orlando states that negotiations on rationing losses resulted on a benefit of u$ 63 million

i challenge that excusing annex v has costed us something between us$ 35 to 70 million

i am not sure what we should do with those numbers. i am not naive to think that annex v would be a piece of cake either.

i just want to note that the good news is  not indeed good news: enron will lose money by foregiving annex v. if that is a conscious decision made by enron corp., that is fine for me. but it has to be a well informed decision.

lm

p.s. as you know, press news are not reliable at all, but there was a news today saying that generators will be gaining up twice.

my initial reaction:

1) rationing losses

i was afraid of this outcome. at least on the surface, i do not like it.  

i have the impression that  it  washes away elektro's initial long position as elektro as it puts and end to annex v discussions. i would have to see the numbers to check  that this solution is equivalent to annex v (for enron). it depends on how one defines ""rationing losses"". 

this solution is perfect  for companies like aes, who were both short in the generation and  in the distribution  businesses. they win on both sides. how are they going to treat annex v provisions when load curtailment reduces to 10% and annex v becomes a liability for elektro? what is going to happen with annex v? (it may be part of the agreement - it is not clear though)

from an elecric sector perspective, this solution corroborates the bail out and the lack of contract sanctity. bad for future investments. 
it would be much more acceptable to increase bulk tariff for generators and allow full pass-through. 

2) ok

3) this had already been achieved. it was an mp (law) enacted by minister parente. the only way we were able to get it was to take aneel to court (here comes my point again - why not being equally bold regarding annex v? perhaps aes influence on abradee?)

what are the terms of final settlement? will they have any provision regarding annex v?

"" by  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the annex 5 controversy the mae should function normally, allowing us to operate eletrobolt and settle against the pool""

three comments:

1) technically not correct - mae recently stopped because of a legal  injunction of itaipu  energy. 
2) it is key to have a functioning mae for eletrobolt. why has abradee voted in favor or procrastinating mae operation three times in the recent past and enron has not exercised a dissenting vote?

"" our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes""   

i would rather not comment on this statement

disegard previous e-mail.
we  reached a conceptual agreement with the government representatives on sunday night.  the main points are:  

     1. rationing losses:   defined methodology giving distribution companies recovery over the next 36 months of rationing losses realised   from june 01 until the end of rationing in 02. recovery includes financial compensation. immediate funding of 80% through bndes, with brazilian government funds. loans liquidated over the 3 year period as tariff increases are realised.  funding scheduled by december 15th.  elektro ebitda impact of approximately r$163 million or us$ 63 million. corrected numbers in second email

       2.  april/may mae settlement :   market will settle under current rules due to pre-rationing conditions, confirming the procedures used on elektro's books.  impact of approximately r$ 18 million or us$ 7 million. 

       3.  parcel  ""a"" for the future:  all non-controlable costs to which ldc's are subjected to including power purchases, sector charges, are passed through to final tariffs either using a tracking account mechanism or by aligning adjustment dates with  the ldc tariff revision date.  tracking account will be subject to financial compensation from the date costs are incurred until the effective pass through and collection , eliminating a major risk for the distribution sector. elektro ebitda impact  2002 forward of r$ 60 million or us$ 19 million, as had been considered in the 2002 plan.  this methodology represents major risk mitigation going forward, as the initial power supply contracts are renewed starting in 2003.

        4. parcel a from the past:   min parente has agreed to the concept recovering non controllable  that were not passed through to tariffs since late 1999 using the same methodology agreed to for future recoveries and has a dedicated team from the federal attorney general's office targeting a final solution in ten days.    elektro impact  is r$145 million or us$ 55 million in 2001. the proposed mechanism for recovery is after the 36 months for the rationing losses.  

we are currently finalising a memo of understanding and the government team is winding up the settlement with the generators in order to finalize the terms of the overall agreement.

min parente has committed to resolving the open issues affecting investors in the power sector.  these  agreements represent a major step forward, significantly improving  the value of our businesses. by  solving the pending issues for the rationing losses, thus eliminating the annex 5 controversy the mae should function normally, allowing us to operate eletrobolt and settle against the pool.  

total amounts for the sector represent about r$ 10 billion or us$3.8 billion at the current rates.  our team has led the sector negotiations for months since the rationing, and have been instrumental in convincing the government of the need for implementing these changes.  "

	your news is not surprising, and we probably can't expect any firm direction until some bigger decisions are taken.

	there hasn't been any information available here about whether japan is core, either.  

	in the mean time, epower is taking a lot of mark's time as they try to figure out how to move their generating plant projects forward.  the egm activity has slowed down considerably, and project sato is stalled until they hear a good explanation, so we are also focusing on the now developing japanese emissions policy, and finalizing some work for eim/forest products.

rick - 

your conference call this morning was quite encouraging from the standpoint of the ga group and i was sincerely pleased to hear that, for the most part, jobs will be saved.

i found it interesting to hear you report that dynegy has expressed interest in enron's retail business, which has prompted me to write to you to follow-up on our discussion of a week ago.  clearly a lot has changes in the past week and it seems that the deal with dynegy should alleviate the paralysis that was understandably taking hold while there was no plan for the future of the company. with that in mind, i wonder if perhaps you might be in a better position to consider the option of utilizing me on a consultant basis in 2002.

rick, i don't believe there is anyone in the group that has a better handle on the retail issues or has provided better commercial support, and therefore i believe it would make good business sense to consider ways to keep me associated with the group.  although i can appreciate how busy you are with other priorities, i wanted to raise the question again now while the subject is fresh in your mind and while i am still very much involved with the business. 

as i have indicated, i would be willing to consider a consulting arrangement for part or all of next year. this would ensure continuity of coverage as the merger transition proceeds. 

i hope you will give the idea serious consideration. 

thanks, 

frank

the short answer is that the dynegy merger with enron does not affect
the nwn acquisition of pge.  both enron and dynegy remain committed to
the nwn transaction.  there are no direct implications for the sale as
nwn, not enron, is the issuer of the equity in the transaction.  the
structure of the seller financing has not changed.  

bruce debolt did describe the only indirect impact of enron's current
situation--i.e., that there are certain restrictions on enron's ability
to transfer the securities it holds to an affiliated interest if enron's
credit rating decays to a given point.  

the enron/dynegy transaction is expected to close in the 3rd quarter of
2002.  we think we can get all regulatory approvals for the nwn
transaction completed and close before that.  

i'm in washington, d.c. today and tomorrow.  we have a pre-filing
meeting with the sec on the nwn transaction tomorrow.  i'll be back in
the office on friday.  i can be reached by pager 888.354.7356 or cell

thanks for the input.  attached is the current version of the data to
support the puct filing.  i have had a couple conversations with richard
greffe of puct staff regarding the requirements of 25.401 and plan to walk
him thru the backup workpapers by the end of the month to get any
suggestions.  i did mention to chairman yzaguirre at a meeting earlier this
week that we might be bringing a filing to the commission but that it was
just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two
commissioners in meetings next week.  while we could possibly play with the
numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my
inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of
caution and to create good will.

subject:	ferc's november 20 agenda

the following proceedings that we've been following for some time are on ferc's agenda for tuesday, november 20.  

aep's three year update of its market based rates

as you may recall, in august, 2000, aep filed its triennial market based rates review with ferc.  on september 21, 2000 and again on october 20, 2000, epmi protested that filing, arguing that aep has market power in transmission so it should not be permitted to continue charging market based rates for wholesale power sales.  now, 15 months later, ferc is planning to act on the filing.

""investigation of terms and conditions of public utility market-based rate authorizations""

this proceeding may be linked to the aep proceeding, although the two are listed separately on ferc's agenda.  while we are not certain what ferc intends to do in this docket, they could be opening up a new investigation into all market based rate authorizations, including non-utility generators and power marketers.  we will monitor this closely and let you know about the proceeding as soon as we learn about it on tuesday.

bangor hydro vs. iso ne

bangor hydro filed a complaint against iso ne on june 15, 2001 arguing that, due to a design flaw in the electronic dispatch, the iso should reset the energy clearing prices that were impacted by this design flaw from december 9, 2001 through the end of march.  the iso opposes bangor's complaint, stating that it cannot reset prices pursuant to market rule 15 unless there was a specific, identifiable error and the iso posted notice of the error within a certain time period after the error is detected.

new york iso extension of automated mitigation procedures

the nyiso filed to extend its amp until october 31, 2002.  many parties oppose the extension, others support it.

new england iso icap proceeding

the commission issued an order on august 28 regarding the icap deficiency charge.  several parties sought rehearing.  the proceeding on the agenda may be the commission's order on those rehearing requests.

coned's in city mitigation

coned filed to extend the in-city mitigation procedures through october 31, 2002.  several parties protested, others support it.

maine puc v. iso ne; ui v. iso ne; bangor hydro v. iso ne

several entities (maine puc, ui, and bangor hydro) filed complaints against iso ne in august, 2000 arguing that the iso should restate the $6,000 energy clearing price that occurred on may 8, 2000.  18 months later, it looks like ferc may be ready to act on these complaints.

hq energy v. nyiso

hq filed a compliant against the nyiso on december 12, 2000 arguing that the iso erroneously restated the energy market clearing price for may 8, 2000.  the commission may be ready to act on this complaint as well.

because the new england complaints and hq complaint all relate to the high energy prices that occurred on may 8, 2000, and whether the isos should have restated those prices, it is likely that the commission will rule the same way in each of the proceedings (either that the iso should have reset the prices or shouldn't have).

reliant and mirant v. caiso

on october 18, 2001, reliant and mirant filed a complaint against the iso arguing that the iso is giving preferential treatment to the dwr and cers and is not following the oom tariff provisions.  epmi submitted comments in support of the complaint.  the case is on the commission's agenda for tuesday.

janet --

here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees.

total headcount = 21.  the personnel cost = $6.4 mm (total for ena and ees).    

please let me know if you have any questions.

1.) need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ena/ees.

3.) the $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. jim fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) we need to reconcile what we do with steve montovano. because both ena/ees want to utilize him, i might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. louise/jim- are you both ok with this? if so, rick/jim, i would suggest putting him in the ne gas box.

janet --

here is the org chart that captures our discussions.  i think that this org and the # of people is the lowest level that can even try to meet the combined needs of ena and ees.

total headcount = 21.  the personnel cost = $6.4 mm (total for ena and ees).    

please let me know if you have any questions.

hi ginger,

i have been working on what i can do for you if you have to cancel your
meeting in december. if you have to cancel, i will have to bill you for 100%
of the amount due. once payment is received, i will credit 50% of that
revenue to a deposit for a future program to be held within the first
quarter of 2002. the revenue credit must be used by 03/31/2002 or it will be
lost.

i will call you later this morning to discuss.

thanks,

you will note that there will no longer be a power marketers working group. that group was organized four years ago to assure that issues of interest to marketers were covered. since that time both our membership and the nature of the issues has changed. most of our board and associate level members now have marketing operations, and issues concerning market development are in the forefront. at this point, having such a subgroup within the regulatory affairs committee causes a lot of confusion.
for this reason, the executive committee agreed with julie simon's and my recommendation to disband the working group after 2001. at the same time, we recommended establishing a vice chair, since the purview of the committee is so broad.

a few months ago, i sent a note to the north american government affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to californ=
ia.  in that memo, i included a quote that went as follows ? ""what we do in=
 life echoes through eternity"".  i think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to enron, of the last few months.  i do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but i do know that what we've=
 done here at enron in government affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in houston, washington, london, brussels, sao paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  we even had a=
 good time doing it.  the good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  my personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, i will continue to do all i can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

on a more holiday-related note, for those in the u.s., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on wednesday in advan=
ce of thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  for tho=
se not celebrating the american thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

thank you.

many of you have received, or will receive in the next few days, requests for information that is necessary for regulatory filings related to the proposed merger with dynegy.  providing this information in the most accurate and expeditious manner possible is of the highest priority.   thank you for your cooperation.

a slightly softer version would be:

subject:=09american thanksgiving
importance:=09high



a few months ago, i sent a note to the north american government affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to californ=
ia.  in that memo, i included a quote that went as follows ? ""what we do in=
 life echoes through eternity"".  i think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to enron, of the last few months.  i do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but i do know that what we've=
 done here at enron in government affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in houston, washington, london, brussels, sao paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  we even had a=
 good time doing it.  the good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  my personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, i will continue to do all i can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

on a more holiday-related note, for those in the u.s., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on wednesday in advan=
ce of thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  for tho=
se not celebrating the american thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

thank you.

;  will the dynegy deal proceed?  by will mcnamara director, electric indus=
try analysis    [news item from reuters] enron corp. (nyse: ene) shares fel=
l sharply in opening trade on nov. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned=
 it could be forced to pay by next week $690 million in debt triggered by a=
 credit downgrade last week. the shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, t=
o just over $7.00 in early morning trade on the new york stock exchange. th=
e stock was the biggest loser by percentage change and the second-most acti=
ve stock on the nyse. as of early morning trading on nov. 21, enron shares =
were priced at $4.85, reportedly their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   a=
nalysis: to paraphrase shakespeare, ""oh, what a tangled web they weave when=
 first they attempt to?"" wait, i better stop. when speaking about enron, i =
am not prepared to finish that sentence, at least at this point. enron has =
been accused of a lot of things over the last few weeks, but at this junctu=
re an ongoing securities and exchange commission (sec) investigation has ye=
t to reach any conclusion regarding deceptive financial reporting on the pa=
rt of the houston trader. enron itself has admitted that its financial reco=
rds from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" n=
evertheless, perception is reality and the perception currently in the indu=
stry is that enron is now taking a fall after getting caught following year=
s of skirting the truth. while negative perception continues to cause damag=
e to enron's stock, perhaps of more current interest are the developments t=
hat are more grounded in reality. we know enron has just lowered its third-=
quarter earnings, faces a stiff payment of $690 million (due within a week,=
 in fact) and has cast doubt over its 4q earnings potential. the question o=
f the hour is whether these new financial hits will represent a ""material a=
dverse change"" in the eyes of dynegy, which still aims to buy enron but wis=
ely included an exit clause in its purchase contract. the other question is=
, what happens to enron if dynegy leaves it standing at the altar? a termin=
ated marriage agreement would surely cause further reductions to enron's al=
ready-weak credit standing, and it is unknown how the company could recover=
 from another blow to its reputation.   as has been the case since the firs=
t of october, the ongoing ""fall of enron"" story is changing by the day. for=
 background on dynegy's proposed acquisition of enron, and enron's financia=
l problems that precipitated the proposal, please see my 11/12/01 issuealer=
t (available at  www.scientech.com/rci ). in the interest of time, let me s=
ummarize what is happening at this moment. dynegy rode in as enron's white =
knight and plopped down a $9-billion offer ($10 a share) to buy the company=
, which at the time represented a steal of a price considering that enron w=
as priced at almost $90 a share little more than a year ago. to some extent=
, this seemed like the final chapter in the enron saga. in other words, the=
 company had gone through a tumultuous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but stil=
l planned to live happily ever after as part of dynegy, inc., its much-smal=
ler rival.    the developments just this week amount to a screeching brake =
that may in fact interrupt the nuptials between the two companies. for star=
ters, on monday (nov. 19), enron submitted its 10-q report to the sec (whic=
h was five days late, by the way). in the report, enron dropped what have t=
urned out to be several bombshells. first, enron disclosed that, due to rec=
ent downgrades of its credit rating by agencies such as moody's, standard &=
 poor's and fitch, it has to pay off or refinance by nov. 26 debt it owes t=
o a third party with which it has a partnership, or face nearly $4 billion =
in additional payments. enron also has the option of finding new collateral=
 to guarantee the debt. enron would not disclose who owns the note, but we =
know that the limited partnership includes holdings in c.e.g. rio, a brazil=
ian natural gas-company that enron had planned to sell to raise about $250 =
million in cash. note that just last week, various credit services lowered =
enron's senior unsecured debt to one notch above junk status and warned tha=
t further downgrades may occur, which apparently prompted the call for the =
debt payment. reportedly, if enron does not make the $690-million payment b=
y nov. 27, investors will gain the right to immediately begin liquidating t=
he asset for an amount equal to the note payable. enron is presently scramb=
ling to establish a ""mutually acceptable"" amendment with lenders to avoid h=
aving to issue payment on the debt. along with the acknowledgement of the i=
mminent payment of $690 million, enron said that any further drop in its cr=
edit rating might necessitate further payments of $3.9 billion to other par=
tnerships, the bulk of that figure going to osprey trust and marlin water t=
rust.    also in the new sec filing, enron increased its 3q 2001 loss by 3 =
cents a share to 87 cents. enron originally reported a 3q loss of $618 mill=
ion, but has now raised that figure to $664 million. as a minor bright side=
, enron did increase reported earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by=
 a penny to 20 cents a share, attributed to adjustments made after the quar=
ter's end. however, looking forward, enron warned that continuing credit wo=
rries and a decline in the value of some of its assets could take a further=
 toll on fourth-quarter earnings. enron also claims that, even still, the n=
umbers contained in the 10-q report are not necessarily final as they have =
not been reviewed by arthur andersen, the company's external auditor. thus,=
 further revision of the numbers could take place.    interestingly, there =
does not seem to be a big question about whether or not enron can pay the $=
690-million debt obligation. enron apparently has secured an additional $2 =
billion in loans from j.p. morgan chase and citigroup in the last week. in =
fact, within the current sec filing, enron says that is has $1.2 billion of=
 domestic cash consisting of the lines of credit and net collections. thus,=
 some investors are reassured by the belief that enron has the cash on hand=
 to make the $690-million payment if it is unable to renegotiate terms with=
 lenders. according to the sec filing, enron also intends to sell off $8 bi=
llion in non-core businesses that are performing ""below acceptable rates"" a=
nd would use the proceeds to pay off debts, although this money would proba=
bly not be immediately available.   again, however, there is a perception e=
lement to this development that should be noted. enron has been accused of =
financing partnerships in the past in such a way as to keep them off the co=
mpany's balance sheets. apparently, this non-disclosure was done so that en=
ron could grow quickly without adding too much debt to its own books or dil=
uting the value of its stock. as has been well documented, enron is already=
 in the midst of an intense sec investigation regarding potential conflict-=
of-issues involving its former cfo. news about other financial deals that m=
ay not have been fully disclosed is clearly making investors even more nerv=
ous about enron's stock.     as i said, the question of the hour is whether=
 or not enron's new problems will cause dynegy to reconsider its offer. as =
usual, the answer all depends on who you ask. dynegy is remaining mum and r=
eferring all questions about enron's financial status to enron. investors a=
re rather mixed on the question. some say that the facts disclosed in the 1=
0-q report do not dramatically change enron's position from what it was whe=
n dynegy launched its acquisition and that the current drop in enron's stoc=
k is just a knee-jerk response to the media hype surrounding the story. fur=
ther, those who diminish any potential impact say that enron is still a liq=
uid company and has money coming in from various sources. thus, it should h=
ave no trouble making the $690-million payment. from a broad perspective, s=
o one theory goes, dynegy is still getting a great deal in enron due to its=
 staggering drop in stock price, and the acquisition remains valuable to dy=
negy as it will position the combined company as north america's biggest ma=
rketer and trader of natural gas and electricity.   in contrast, other inve=
stors point to the fact that since the purchase agreement was signed, enron=
's stock has fallen an additional 32.5 percent, which weakens the original =
acquisition agreement. in addition, if enron follows through with the $690-=
million payment next week or secures additional financing to front this cos=
t, both options alter the company's financial position from when dynegy mad=
e its original offer, which could be construed as a ""material adverse chang=
e.""   another interesting development indicates that enron may no longer be=
 the company that dynegy agreed to purchase. new reports indicate many ener=
gy trading companies are now unwilling to sell power or natural gas to enro=
n for fear about the company's credit concerns. such companies are now part=
icularly reticent to sell power to enron for next-day delivery. what this m=
eans in practical terms is that other trading companies may be gaining enro=
n's market share, which could diminish the value in the trading market that=
 had attracted dynegy to enron in the first place. in addition, enron's onc=
e-stellar energy trading business could now become reduced or collapse alto=
gether.   questions have been raised why dynegy is not doing more at this t=
ime to help enron out of its financial mess. of course, under the acquisiti=
on agreement dynegy already committed to providing an immediate $1.5-billio=
n asset-backed equity infusion into enron to help the company with its curr=
ent financial woes, which will be followed by an additional infusion of $2.=
5 billion into the combined company by chevrontexaco, which owns 27 percent=
 of dynegy. however, some traders apparently have wondered why dynegy has n=
ot done anything about enron's diminishing ability to secure power on the o=
pen market. traders claim that dynegy could step in and buy power from sell=
ers on the behalf of enron, in a strategy known as ""sleeving."" the fact tha=
t dynegy has not chosen to take this step has been an indication to some ob=
servers that it is only willing to go so far in its pursuit of enron.   in =
addition, enron shareholders launched a lawsuit on nov. 12 in state court i=
n houston to prevent the merger with dynegy from happening. the petition re=
portedly alleges that enron directors breached their fiduciary duties by ag=
reeing to sell the company at too low a price and without adequate consider=
ation of other alternatives. enron said it will defend its decision in cour=
t.    moreover, dynegy was smart to include an exit clause in the acquisiti=
on agreement. the clause reportedly allows dynegy to walk away from enron i=
f any material adverse change occurs related to the outcome of the sec inve=
stigation, possible litigation against enron, balance sheet strengths, and =
earnings forecasts. certainly the latest developments disclosed in enron's =
10-q filing with the sec impact the company's balance sheet strengths and e=
arnings forecasts, so a case could be made that dynegy would have grounds t=
o terminate the acquisition. clearly, this pending deal hinges on the devel=
opments that will take place over the next few weeks. dynegy ultimately wil=
l have to weigh the pros and cons of its acquisition offer for enron and de=
termine if the once-golden company still represents a great deal, or if pur=
suing the purchase would cause more trouble than it is worth.    an archive=

subject:=09american thanksgiving
importance:=09high



a few months ago, i sent a note to the north american government affairs gr=
oup commemorating a bit of an end point in our efforts relative to californ=
ia.  in that memo, i included a quote that went as follows ? ""what we do in=
 life echoes through eternity"".  i think of these words often and believe t=
hem more than ever, particularly after the events, both external and intern=
al to enron, of the last few months.  i do not know for sure what the next =
few weeks or months will bring for any of us, but i do know that what we've=
 done here at enron in government affairs over the last several years, whet=
her in houston, washington, london, brussels, sao paulo, etc. was very good=
 and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made i=
n the industries in which we have worked and for each other.  we even had a=
 good time doing it.  the good work we do will go on for many, if not, all =
of us . . . for some, here; for others, elsewhere. =20

regardless of what the future holds, we should all be quite proud of what w=
e have accomplished here and how it has been accomplished.  my personal app=
reciation for all that you have done as well as at having had the opportuni=
ty to be part of a group that, unfortunately, will be inalterably impacted =
and changed over the next few weeks, is boundless.  irrespective of where t=
hese changes may take any one of us, i will continue to do all i can to ear=
n your trust and respect. =20

on a more holiday-related note, for those in the u.s., who are working this=
 week, please feel free to leave as early as possible on wednesday in advan=
ce of thanksgiving to spend time with your families or loved ones.  for tho=
se not celebrating the american thanksgiving, you too should try and take s=
ome additional time for yourself and families over the next few days, work =
and business demands permitting.

thank you.

 quote of the week <http://g.fool.com/art/email/subheaders/419x40qotd.gif>	
""as you take a few minutes to ponder all that you have to be thankful for, take an additional few minutes to think of the billions of people who don't have it so good. even as we suffer from a declining economy and terrible acts of murder, as a nation we're still more fortunate than most people on earth. in many places, malnutrition and dysentery are the rule rather than the exception. our poverty would be prosperity in most of the countries of the world. in hard times, it's more necessary than ever to remember how rich our lives are.""

 weekend warrior <http://g.fool.com/art/email/subheaders/419x40warrior.gif>	
can you save $100 a month?
if you cut your spending by $100 a month and invested that money in a tax-deferred retirement account, you would add $145,346 to your nest egg by the time you retire at age 65 (assuming you're 40 now and earn an 11% average annual return). wow. pretty inspiring, eh? try it yourself with this calculator  <http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=543400>to see how your stats add up. then check out these guidelines for finding those extra 100 donuts a month: 

do you know how much you spend on groceries? on books? on utilities? if not, fire up any old spreadsheet and start recording your expenses. you can visit the ""how much am i spending?""  <http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=543401>calculator for a list of categories, and it'll even count the beans for ya. review your checkbook, bank account statements, and credit card statements and start filling in the blanks. 


 if you find yourself faced with a lot of ""$100 atm withdrawal"" items in your history, you'll need to do a little more work to see where you've been indulging. try this: every time you use cash, keep the receipt. if the receipt doesn't list what you purchased, write it on the receipt. every night, put the receipts in a jar. at the end of the month, enter the items in your expense-tracking spreadsheet and you'll know exactly how much you've been spending. 


as you pile up your savings, sock it away regularly -- automatic savings plans are a beautiful thing. you can set up an automatic deposit to a money market fund <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543402>, for example, and earn some interest in the short run. when you have enough dough saved to open an individual retirement account, pat yourself on the back, then check out our 60-second guide to iras <http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=543403> for the fast track to building your nest egg. 

so there's your game plan: trade a few minor extravagances for the long-term comfort and security of a bulging retirement account. that's a pretty sweet deal.

cirumstances will dictate the outcome. since we last spoke about layoffs
in my group, the situation has grown worse...as of the moment, and
assuming no further erosion, the north american group directly under my
charge will shrink next week  to 29 professionals and 5 support staff
and a budget of $9.4 million dollars( down from $32.8 million dollars in
2001). in addition, europe government affairs  will likely shrink to no
more than 3 professionals and a budget of approximately $750,000
dollars. the layoffs are slated for sometime in the upcoming week(week
of november 26) with people departing the same day they are given
notice. as you can imagine, this is a particularly painful  process,
especially since i hired most of these people as we were building what i
considered and will always consider to be a world-class organization. we
not only built a  group of government affairs professionals who were
talented, hard-working and who  had many successes at opening energy
markets, but who, also, with few exceptions, embodied a set of values;
e.g; honesty, integrity, decency toward others( friend or foe) that were
not always as plentiful throughout the enron culture as many, including
myself, would have hoped. 
         to cut to the quick, i'm tired of the weight that burdens all
of us who remain at enron( i can explain this further) and am actively
seeking a change in my personal circumstances.( steve kean knows i am
looking, but doesn't know specifically about this note...i don't believe
he would object given the context). i have thought long and hard about
sending this note...it is not easily done. i have also thought about
whether it will be percieved as abandonment of my group if i were to
move on soon...this may be a rationalization, but after seeing through
next week's layoffs, there is little left to do that has not already
beeen done. i also believe that ( and you may talk to folks in my group
for validation) i have done the very best i could for them over the last
few months under challenging circumstances. bottom line, my skills and
personal network , that i believe are considerable, will be grossly
underutilized at enron over the next 6-9 months if i were to stay.( if
the acquisition stays on track, this view may  not be exactly right) i'd
be happy to talk about this with you further if you so desire. in
addition to my work #(713-853-3407) and e-mail, i can always be reached
at home(936-321-7153).
 
thanks very much, rick"
2001-11-23 14:48:53-08:00,robert.hemstock,admin support - canada gov't affairs,"rick,

some changes are appropriate regarding the canada gov't affairs group's use of enron canada support staff and the allocation of their salaries to the gov't affairs given things like aleck's departure, fino's use of support, etc. and the need to generally reduce costs:    

						current allocation			proposed after dec 1/01
lisa assaf - toronto  				50% of $46,000/year			$0
sara butt - calgary (fino)			25% of $38,000/year			$0
linda sietzema - calgary (rob/randy)		50% of $44,000/year			$0

megan scott - calgary (rob/randy)							100% of $28,000/year		

this plan will reduce the enron canada support staff allocation to gov't affairs from its current level of $58,000/year to $28,000/year until end of q1 2002 when i plan to put a new gov't affairs person in toronto that will need some level of support (say 25% of $46,000).

are you okay with this?  please confirm and then i will proceed to have enron canada revise its present allocation to gov't affairs.

regards,

rob

christi: as discussed, attached is a copy of a quote that the nyiso has asked me to include in a press release they plan to issue announcing the release of some draft icap principles that have been developed by the three northeast iso staffs. i've discussed the quote with sarah, and have included some new language to make clear that enron does not support icap markets, but while we have them this is a good idea. i haven't shown this language to the iso yet, as i'm waiting to hear back from rick on whether enron wants to be quoted at all. i'd appreciate it if you could take a quick look at the attached revised quote and perhaps run it by rick. thanks. howard

i am not sure, that in any of the calls that we have had during the crisis =
surrounding enron, that i have been able to fully express the depth of my g=
ratitude to each of you.  i am as grateful as one can be.  like many of you=
, i loved this place and feel an immense sense of loss at what is occurring=
.  my heart also aches for the financial losses that so many have suffered,=
 not only in our group, but also throughout the company, particularly given=
 how much all of us have given to this place, some for many years.  i have =
been searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a =
book the other day about teddy roosevelt, former president of the united st=
ates, and saw a quote that i thought was appropriate to our group and circu=
mstances?the quote is,=20

""the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives =
valiantly, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends =
himself in worthy causes.  who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievem=
ent and who, at worst, if he fails, fails while daring greatly so that his =
place shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither vict=
ory nor defeat.""

the work that we did here was great.  the way we did it, i believe, sets an=
 example for those who will attempt to fill our shoes?and we fought for the=
 right cause, i.e., competitive markets around the world.  our victories we=
re many and often directly due to our presence and leadership?the failure t=
hat we are experiencing as a company, however, that is so deep and so thoro=
ugh, was not of our making.  i don't know exactly what the days and weeks a=
head hold for any of us, but i am quite confident that the good work that w=
e do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were abl=
e to create in this group, will show up in new places and new companies all=
 around the world over the next months and years.  i hope to speak to many,=
 if not all of you, on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to ex=
press my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with y=
ou, but i also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best i=
n the future and during this holiday season.

the information below was provided to us by the fbi's awareness of national security issues and response (ansir) program.

the u.s. postal service (usps) has advised that certain types of incoming u.s. government mail in the zip code range 202xx-205xx will continue to be irradiated in lima, ohio for the foreseeable future.  mail being irradiated includes letters, flats, packages, express mail and priority mail with stamps for postage.  mail from known mailers is not being irradiated, which includes usps express mail with meter strips and corporate accounts, usps priority mail with meter strips or permit indicia, all registered mail, and bulk quantity mail such as catalogs and magazines.  in addition, mail sent through private shipping companies, such as fedex, ups, dhl and airborne, is not being irradiated.

significant backlogs are occurring at the usps as a result of the irradiation process.  these backlogs will continue until an additional irradiation facility is tested and opened in bridgeport, connecticut.  the usps recommends that a range of items not be irradiated, including:  magnetic media (credit card, floppy disk, cd-rom, etc.); plastics sensitive to heat and radiation warping; consumer electronics; photographic film; and photosensitive film and paper.  for these reasons, the fbi recommends using one of the methods mentioned above that will not subject mail to irradiation for corporate communication with u.s. government offices in these zip codes.

rick,
how are you doing?

where is steve off too?  did he even say goodbye?

i'm still perseverating over enron.  i can't help myself.  horrible 
time to be laid off -- can't talk to be people to find work because 
everyone is on vacation.

i've heard lots of rumors about severance.  has enron asked or is it 
planning to ask the bk court for real severance for employees already 
dumped or is its plan only to seek real severance for those who were 
kept on after dec 3?  i finally got my expense check deposited.  that 
was welcome.  what about all our vendors? did they get screwed too? 
all - or some -- do we pay our utility bill but not our $500 bill to 
the arem lobbyist?  do we pay safeway for drinks for the fridge, but 
not our $3000 retainer to dan douglass?  this all seems arbitrary, 
crass and unfair.  how can ken lay look at himself in the mirror 
every day knowing how many employees he has harmed?  i can understand 
how the company cannot control the stock market and the effects of 
that implosion, but i cannot understand how can the company can 
brazenly cut so many people with only a $4500, less taxes, etc., 
check as so-called severance -- not even paying accrued vacation .  i 
and many others would feel a lot better about the company if our 
rights and good will hadn't been trampled on.

i haven't been able to look for work much -- no one is around.  so, i 
guess i'm spending too much time thinking about this stuff.

here comes 2002, thank god!
